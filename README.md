# Ordinals Launcher

## Introduction

The Ordinals Launcher is the first permissionless launcher for ordinals collections, leveraging inscriptions to allow collection creators and minters to mint ordinals with ease.

You can monitor collections launched using the Ordinals Launcher using this [Dashboard](https://dune.com/j543/ordinals-launcher)

You can use the following tools to index inscriptions from the Ordinals Launcher: [Ordinals Launcher Tracker](https://github.com/jerryfane/ord-launcher-tracker)

## How It Works

The Ordinals Launcher is a recursive inscription. Collection creators can compile the `/src/asset.html` file with their collection details and inscribe it for a fully functional launcher on-chain. Minters can then open this inscription from any ordinals explorer (e.g., [Ordinals.com](https://ordinals.com)) and mint the assets using the Xverse wallet ([xverse.app](https://xverse.app)).

### Requirements

- **IPFS Integration:** For proper display of non-inscribed assets on Ordinals Explorer, the launcher utilizes IPFS.
- **Inscription Helper Extension:** The optimal functionality of the Ordinals Launcher requires the Inscription Helper browser extension. [Inscription Helper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/u/2/detail/inscription-helper/pkkadlgleljakhldkfolmhippjegighm)

## Launching Your Collection

To launch your collection using the Ordinals Launcher, follow these steps:

1. **Upload Assets:** Upload your assets (currently supporting images) to IPFS under the same folder. Name your assets as `1.png`, `2.png`, ..., `<YOURSUPPLY>.png`, starting from 1. You can use tools like [Thirdweb Storage](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/infrastructure/storage) for IPFS uploads.

2. **Copy IPFS Reference:** Copy the IPFS reference/pointer to your folder.

3. **Prepare `asset.html`:** Copy `/src/asset.html` and insert your collection details. Ensure accuracy, especially the recursive inscription reference, IPFS reference to your digital assets, and if applicable, your receiving address for paid mints.

4. **Inscribe `asset.html`:** Inscribe the `asset.html` file using any inscription service.
