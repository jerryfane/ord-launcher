<ol>
<li><p><strong>Introduction to the Code</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This HTML template (the &quot;<strong>Code</strong>&quot;) allows you to create and launch collections of digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain (&quot;<strong>Ordinals</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>Collection</strong>&quot;). </li>
<li>By using this Code, you agree to be bound by these terms of service (&quot;<strong>ToS</strong>&quot;). </li>
<li>The ToS do not govern your relationship with your wallet software provider, which are governed by the terms and conditions of such provider.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Description of the Code</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Code allows you to create and launch your own Ordinals collection without the need of any intermediary and third parties to inscribe their assets of the Collection. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The Code does not offer any other service. </p>
<p>The Code does not have any power in relation to your collection. In particular but not limited to, the Code does not govern (i) the fees of your collection, (ii) the files(s) that you link to your collection, (iii) the price of your collection, (iv) the amount of items in your collection, (v) the rights that are linked to your collection (e.g. utility, security). </p>
<p>The Code does not take part in any phase of the creation and/or offering of your collection. </p>
<p>Through the Code we do not offer professional services but we simply share the Code as open source and subject to this ToS to any third party that intends to use it free of charge to create its own collection. </p>
<p>As we are not providing the Code for purposes relating to our trade, business, craft or profession, we do not qualify as &quot;traders&quot; and/or &quot;business&quot; under consumer law and the use of the Code by you does not qualify as a &quot;business to consumer service&quot;.</p>
